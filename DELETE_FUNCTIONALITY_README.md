# Delete Functionality Implementation

This document describes the implementation of delete functionality for categories and products in the application.

## Features

### 1. Delete Buttons
- **Consistent Styling**: All delete buttons use the same red color scheme (`bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600`)
- **Icon Integration**: Uses `Trash2` icon from Lucide React for visual consistency
- **Loading States**: Shows "Deleting..." text and disables button during deletion
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

### 2. Confirmation Dialog
- **Custom Component**: Replaces browser's basic `confirm()` with a styled modal
- **Variant Support**: Supports danger, warning, and info variants with appropriate colors
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### 3. Toast Notifications
- **Success Messages**: Green toast notifications for successful deletions
- **Error Messages**: Red toast notifications for failed operations
- **Consistent Format**: All messages follow the same pattern
- **Auto-dismiss**: Toasts automatically disappear after a few seconds

### 4. API Integration
- **Centralized API Layer**: All API calls go through `lib/api.ts`
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with custom `ApiError` class
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for API responses
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports different API URLs via environment variables

## Implementation Details

### Components

#### ConfirmDialog (`components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx`)
- Modal dialog for delete confirmations
- Supports different variants (danger, warning, info)
- Loading states during async operations
- Click outside to close functionality

#### API Utility (`lib/api.ts`)
- Centralized API request handling
- Custom error classes for better error handling
- Support for different HTTP methods
- Environment-based configuration

### Pages Updated

#### Categories Page (`app/categories/page.tsx`)
- Added delete button to actions column
- Integrated with ConfirmDialog component
- Uses API utility for delete operations
- Toast notifications for feedback

#### Products Page (`app/products/page.tsx`)
- Added delete button to actions column
- Integrated with ConfirmDialog component
- Uses API utility for delete operations
- Toast notifications for feedback

## Usage

### Basic Delete Flow
1. User clicks delete button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms deletion
4. API call is made
5. Success/error toast is shown
6. UI is updated accordingly

### API Endpoints
- **Categories**: `DELETE /api/categories/{id}/`
- **Products**: `DELETE /api/products/{id}/`

### Environment Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Styling

### Button Classes
```css
/* Delete Button */
bg-red-500 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded hover:bg-red-600 
disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed flex items-center gap-1

/* Other Action Buttons */
bg-blue-500 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded hover:bg-blue-600  /* Details */
bg-yellow-500 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded hover:bg-yellow-600  /* Edit */
```

### Toast Styling
- **Success**: Green background with white text
- **Error**: Red background with white text
- **Auto-dismiss**: 4 seconds by default

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Connection failures
- Timeout issues
- Invalid responses

### API Errors
- 4xx status codes (client errors)
- 5xx status codes (server errors)
- Custom error messages from backend

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages in toasts
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Bulk Delete**: Support for deleting multiple items at once
2. **Soft Delete**: Option to mark items as deleted instead of removing them
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all delete operations for compliance
4. **Undo Functionality**: Allow users to undo recent deletions
5. **Permission System**: Role-based access control for delete operations

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, rollback on error
2. **Batch Operations**: Group multiple API calls
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to categories/products page
2. Click delete button on any item
3. Verify confirmation dialog appears
4. Confirm deletion
5. Check toast notification
6. Verify item is removed from table

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for API utility functions
- Integration tests for delete flow
- E2E tests for complete user journey
- Error handling tests
